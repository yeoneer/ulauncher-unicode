## Troubleshooting

- **Unicode character icons do not shown properly**:

  The icon for a character depends on the fonts installed on your device
  and the 'Unicode Character Icon Font' preference.

  Ensure that you have the appropriate preference or font installed that is
  capable of displaying the character.

  If the icon is Block Icon(ðŸ›‡, Prohibited Icon), it means that the character
  is a non-printable character. In Unicode, it's a Control Character.
  [Control character - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_character)

- **'Unicode Character Icon Font' preference changes not affected immediately**:

  This preference changes will not take effect properly
  until Ulauncher is restarted.
